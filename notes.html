You know, when you showed me your aparment, I was really imagining how life would be if we were on a vacation and can stay there together. We can do so many fun things togetherr, with the ocean view... Love ya" },
    { title: "I love your haircut", content: "Hey babe, I know you got a haircut today haha. I really like it! Your hair has always been one of my favorite things about you - except for your sweet smile and squishy legs hehe. You know, speaking of your smile, it kind of reminds me of the Hershey's white chocolate bar. It's our chocolate, and I really like it - but you are lowkey sweeter than it 😉. " },
    { title: "Finally done coding", content: "Lottieee, after so long, I finally got this website working and active (sorry to keep you waiting and thank you for being patient) so I'm just gonna briefly explain how this works~ Each notes unlock at 7:00 in the morning on that day, so you can check them when you wake up or just whenver you want. Well you told me that you are going to watch a movie today, is that so? I'm probably going to be asleep by the time you get back so you should text me and tell me how it was, so I can receive them in my dreams and so I can dream of you(I wanna kiss you so badly rnnn).  I love you 3000 times (beat that 😛 )" },
    { title: "Tu es comme une fleur", content: "You know, when I was eight, I read a poem from a book I own, and I decided that if I met a girl that I love, I will show this poem to her. And know I want you to have it. \n Tu es comme une fleur, \n Toute charmante, belle et pure. \n Je te contemple, et mon coeur S’emplit d’une tristesse infinie. \n Je voudrais poser mes mains Sur ton front, \n en priant Dieu Qu’il veuille te garder ainsi,\n Toute pure, belle et charmante." },
    { title: "10 things I hate about you", content: "Honestly nothing. But here's ten things I love about you: I love your hair, its scent when I put my face in it; I love your lips, the way they kiss mine and leave your sweetest sentences; I love your smile, how they goes straight into my heart like a wine chocolate; I love your personality, how you are kind and genuine to others and always optimistic towards everything; I love the way you kiss me, I love your squishiness, I love the way you surround my neck with your arms, I love how petite you are, I love the way you smell... I love YOU, Charlotte." },
    { title: "Crush", content: "I think I told you about how I had a crush on you. And you always wanted to read my journals. I'll quote some things I wrote about you: 'I ... dreamed a lot. I dreamed about Charlotte all the way. Nothing exiciting happened though, she just exists there and I acted like how I would act in normal world.  The dream was pretty lucid, and I think like the way I do but i just didnt realize i was in the dream.  Oh and she went to my birthday party...' '...screw what other says bro, just be happy and live my life the fullest, thats what i want to do. Talk to Charlotte - if I can, dont leave any regrets.' '(one random thursday school day morning in october 2024) It’s 6:23 . Last night I dreamt she looked at me with that kind of gaze. Gentle. With unspeakable feelings, I guess. We locked eyes for a long time. Finally, I looked away. When I looked back, her faced was turned away too - blushing. ' I had a huge crush on you, Charlotte. " },
    { title: "First Kiss", content: "I went on a date with her today. I gave her a bouquet of white roses and daisies. She loved it, and we held hands. Later we went to see a movie. I held her close in my arms, then asked if she wanted to kiss. She said yes. The first attempt was shy—we just pressed our lips together briefly before pulling away. I asked if she wanted to try again. This time, I gently took her lips into mine, and she kissed back. I forgot to breathe and nearly suffocated. She slid her tongue inside, so we started French kissing. We kissed for a long time. She'd softly giggle now and then. So did I. When our lips parted, I gasped for air. Almost instinctively, we held each other tight. My eyes misted over, and I felt incredibly happy. After the kiss, I held her close, and she leaned into me. I gently stroked her hair while feeding her popcorn. She softly caressed my hand. I asked if she wanted to kiss again. She agreed. This time, I breathed calmly and evenly. We kissed for a long time. Lots of tongue. A little bit of teeth. I wanted to kiss her forever. She's so cute." },
    { title: "Childhood Memory", content: "When I was nine years old, I made a real friend. We met in a choir, and later decided to study and travel together. Once, we went to a Snow Mountain. On the first night, we stayed at a campsite. His name was Simeon. We spent an entire afternoon playing by a small stream—I was building a nature park, and he was building a dam. That night, we happily ate barbecue together, sat by the fire, and played on the swings. When it was time to sleep, we went back into the tent and talked. He told me that he had another good friend named Grace. He would tell her that she was his best friend—but actually, I was his best friend. He turned his head and smiled at me. I didn’t say anything, but you wouldn’t understand the weight of that moment. Many of my childhood memories include Simeon. I remember the summer of 2020, when we moved to the residential area where his family lived. The church was not far away. We would go play at church together and then walk back together. Beside us was a wide river, part of the city’s green belt at the time. Both of us rode scooters while our parents chatted happily nearby. The sunlight was endlessly warm, and the air was filled with the scent of vanilla. I remember thinking, maybe life is meant to be like this. And after that thought, Simeon and I rode straight down a very, very steep slope together." },
    { title: "christmas crisis", content: "You know, I'm really having a severe christmas crisis rn. I didn't get my momd presents yet(which I will try my hardest to get like TODAY) and I have to set everything up. Somehow it doesn't feel christmasy at all here, you know, it feels like summer, or early december. I expect christmas to be snowy, cozy with fire in the furnace, sound of wood cracking and cinnamon scent. I wish we, yes we will have a christmas like that together some day. The biggest christmas crisis for me, isn't actuakky those present stuff. it's the fact that I'm not with you." },
    { title: "Childhood Memory 3", content: "When I was in second grade, my school was located in a place called Lido Park. It was huge, and our school itself was a large white villa. Every day there was joyful. There was an enormous park, a playground, and even a swimming pool— abandoned, with a dead cat floating inside. Each grade had its own secret base. Back then, everyone talked about building a treehouse together, but the plan was never carried out. That was where I learned how to swing, how to run, how to play rugby, and how to get along with people my own age. The good times didn’t last. Because the Chinese government disliked Christianity and did not allow this kind of Christian private school, in the spring of my third-grade year, our school was shut down. We were in the middle of a math class. Our teacher told us we would have a week off. Then, at that very moment, the police kicked the door open. He tried to stay calm and told us to go outside, though he probably didn’t expect them to arrive so quickly. That whole day, we played on the vast lawn of Lido Park. When we got thirsty and had no water, I went back to the school to get some. The entire campus was filled with police. The tables where we used to eat lunch were occupied by police officers. I forced myself to stay calm and walked away. We students were carefree. But later, under the excuse of 'no fire hydrants' and 'insufficient safety equipment,' our school was permanently shut down. We were not bad people. Yet the police came to arrest us. Why? Because they did not want us to have faith. We moved away. Years later, I returned to Lido Park. The white villa that used to be our school had become ruins, its walls covered in crude graffiti. The doors stood wide open. I walked to the backyard where our little vegetable garden used to be— now overgrown with weeds. Our English teacher once said that the vegetable seeds we planted had grown. Big tomatoes. Big pumpkins. There was nothing. This must be a mistake, I thought. I walked into what used to be my empty second-grade classroom. The walls were covered in graffiti and dust. Then I looked down and found the drawings we had made in second grade. One of them was mine. I had drawn an angel, with a line of scripture beside it: “For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son…” The others were already torn apart. I asked my mom if I could take my drawing home. She said, forget it—it’s too dirty. So I left that drawing in the empty classroom. And my innocent heart was left forever in the winter when I was seven years old." },
    { title: "Childhood Memory 4", content: "That classroom once held the clearest, brightest laughter. That playground once echoed with cries of 'Who can swing the highest?' That lawn had giant rocks we climbed again and again. That park carried our unfulfilled treehouse plans and our secret bases. That place held our favorite, most beloved school. Not just a school— a part of our childhood was left there too. … Before we left, we found a bird trapped inside the villa. She was a hummingbird, blue-green in color. She couldn’t find her way out, so we carried her outside. The moment she reached the open air, she flew away. A blue bird— a symbol of happiness and beauty— flew away. Perhaps it was telling me to face the future. Perhaps it was saying that the future would be better. She never returned. And the warmth I shared with my companions that winter also became a memory— gone forever, never to return." },
